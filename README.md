# automata-and-formal-languages
Material for an automata and formal languages course written in the verification-aware programming language Dafny.

The course closely follows [Automata, Computability, and Complexity: Theory and Applications](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ear/cs341/automatabook/students.html) by Elaine Rich.
Accordingly, most (if not all) of the key definitions, algorithms, and exercises, in the included Dafny programs, quote the source location either in the book itself or in the accompanying Powerpoint slides.

Presented at [Dafny 2026](https://popl26.sigplan.org/home/dafny-2026) on 11 January 2026. Here are the [talk's slides](dafny-2026/AFL-Dafny2026-Presentation.pdf).
